                    Simple User Names and Passwords
                    draft-ietf-precis-saslprepbis-02

Abstract

   This document describes how to handle Unicode strings representing
   simple user names and passwords, primarily for purposes of
   comparison.  This profile is intended to be used by Simple
   Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanisms (such as PLAIN
   and SCRAM-SHA-1), as well as other protocols that exchange simple
   user names or passwords.  This document obsoletes RFC 4013.

Internet-Draft       PRECIS: Usernames and Passwords          April 2013


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   User names and passwords are used pervasively in authentication and
   authorization on the Internet.  To increase the likelihood that the
   input and comparison of user names and passwords will work in ways
   that make sense for typical users throughout the world, this document
   defines rules for preparing and comparing internationalized strings
   that represent simple user names and passwords.  (In many
   authentication technologies passwords are not directly compared
   because the actual password is used as input to an algorithm such as
   a hash function; however, non-ASCII code points in the input string
   still need to be handled correctly.)

   The algorithms defined in this document assume that all strings are
   comprised of characters from the Unicode character set [UNICODE].

   The algorithms are designed for use in Simple Authentication and
   Security Layer (SASL) [RFC4422] mechanisms, such as PLAIN [RFC4616]
   and SCRAM-SHA-1 [RFC5802].  However, they might be applicable
   wherever simple user names or passwords are used.  This profile is
   not intended for use in preparing strings that are not simple user
   names (e.g., email addresses, DNS domain names, LDAP distinguished
   names), nor in cases where identifiers or secrets are not strings
   (e.g., keys or certificates) or require different handling (e.g.,
   case folding).

   This document builds upon the PRECIS framework defined in
   [FRAMEWORK], which differs fundamentally from the stringprep
   technology [RFC3454] used in SASLprep [RFC4013].  The primary
   difference is that stringprep profiles allowed all characters except
   those which were explicitly disallowed, whereas PRECIS profiles
   disallow all characters except those which are explicitly allowed
   (this "inclusion model" was originally used for internationalized
   domain names in [RFC5891]; see [RFC5894] for further discussion).  It
   is important to keep this distinction in mind when comparing the
   technology defined in this document to SASLprep [RFC4013].

   This document obsoletes RFC 4013.

1.2.  Terminology

   Many important terms used in this document are defined in
   [FRAMEWORK], [RFC4422], [RFC5890], [RFC6365], and [UNICODE].  The
   term "non-ASCII space" refers to any Unicode code point with a
   general category of "Zs", with the exception of U+0020 (here called
   "ASCII space").

Internet-Draft       PRECIS: Usernames and Passwords          April 2013


   As used here, the term "password" is not literally limited to a word;
   i.e., a password could be a passphrase consisting of more than one
   word, perhaps separated by spaces or other such characters.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


2.  Simple User Names

2.1.  Definition

   Some SASL mechanisms (e.g., CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, and SCRAM) specify
   that the authentication identity used in the context of such
   mechanisms is a "simple user name" (see Section 2 of [RFC4422] as
   well as [RFC4013]).  However, the exact form of a simple user name in
   any particular mechanism or deployment thereof is a local matter, and
   a simple user name does not necessarily map to an application
   identifier such as the localpart of an email address.

   For purposes of preparation and comparison of authentication
   identities, this document specifies that a simple user name is a
   string of Unicode code points [UNICODE], encoded using UTF-8
   [RFC3629], and structured either as an ordered sequence of
   "simpleparts" (where the complete simple user name can consist of a
   single simplepart or a space-separated sequence of simpleparts) or as
   a simplepart@domainpart (where the domainpart is an IP literal, an
   IPv4 address, or a fully-qualified domain name).

   Therefore the syntax for a simple user name is defined as follows
   using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) as specified in
   [RFC5234].

      simpleusername = simplepart [1*(1*SP simplepart)]
                       / simplepart '@' domainpart
      simplepart     = 1*(idpoint)
                       ;
                       ; an "idpoint" is a UTF-8 encoded
                       ; Unicode code point that conforms to
                       ; the PRECIS "IdentifierClass"
                       ;
      domainpart     = IP-literal / IPv4address / ifqdn
                       ;
                       ; the "IPv4address" and "IP-literal"
                       ; rules are defined in RFC 3986, and
                       ; the first-match-wins (a.k.a. "greedy")
                       ; algorithm described in RFC 3986
                       ; applies to the matching process
                       ;
                       ; note well that reuse of the IP-literal
                       ; rule from RFC 3986 implies that IPv6
                       ; addresses are enclosed in square
                       ; brackets (i.e., beginning with '['
                       ; and ending with ']')
                       ;
      ifqdn          = 1*1023(domainpoint)
                       ;
                       ; a "domainpoint" is a UTF-8 encoded
                       ; Unicode code point that conforms to
                       ; RFC 5890
                       ;

   Note well that all code points and blocks not explicitly allowed in
   the PRECIS IdentifierClass are disallowed; this includes private use
   characters, surrogate code points, and the other code points and
   blocks defined as "Prohibited Output" in Section 2.3 of RFC 4013.

   Note also that common constructions such as "user@example.com" are
   allowed as simple user names when using software that conforms to
   this specification, as they were under [RFC4013].

2.2.  Preparation

   A simple user name MUST NOT be zero bytes in length.  This rule is to
   be enforced after any normalization and mapping of code points.

   Each simplepart of a simple user name MUST conform to the definition
   of the PRECIS IdentifierClass provided in [FRAMEWORK], where the
   width mapping, additional mapping, case mapping, normalization, and
   directionality rules are as described below.

   1.  Fullwidth and halfwidth characters MUST be mapped to their
       decomposition equivalents.
   2.  Additional mappings MAY be applied, such as those defined in
       [I-D.ietf-precis-mappings].
   3.  Uppercase and titlecase characters MUST be mapped to their
       lowercase equivalents.
   4.  Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC) MUST be applied to all
       characters.

   With regard to directionality, the "Bidi Rule" provided in [RFC5893]
   applies.


3.  Passwords

3.1.  Definition

   For purposes of preparation and comparison of passwords, this
   document specifies that a password is a string of Unicode code points
   [UNICODE], encoded using UTF-8 [RFC3629], and conformant to the
   PRECIS FreeformClass.

   Therefore the syntax for a password is defined as follows using the
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) as specified in [RFC5234].

      password       = 1*(freepoint)
                       ;
                       ; a "freepoint" is a UTF-8 encoded
                       ; Unicode code point that conforms to
                       ; the PRECIS "FreeformClass"
                       ;

   Note well that all code points and blocks not explicitly allowed in
   the PRECIS FreeformClass are disallowed; this includes private use
   characters, surrogate code points, and the other code points and
   blocks defined as "Prohibited Output" in Section 2.3 of RFC 4013.

3.2.  Preparation

   A password MUST NOT be zero bytes in length.  This rule is to be
   enforced after any normalization and mapping of code points.

   A password MUST be treated as follows, where the operations specified
   MUST be completed in the order shown:

   1.  Width mapping is not applied.

Internet-Draft       PRECIS: Usernames and Passwords          April 2013


   2.  Map any instances of non-ASCII space to ASCII space (U+0020).
   3.  Case mapping is not applied.
   4.  Apply Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC) to all characters.
   5.  Ensure that the resulting string conforms to the definition of
       the PRECIS FreeformClass.

   With regard to directionality, the "Bidi Rule" (defined in [RFC5893])
   and similar rules are unnecessary and inapplicable to passwords,
   since they can reduce the range of characters that are allowed in a
   string and therefore reduce the amount of entropy that is possible in
   a password.  Furthermore, such rules are intended to minimize the
   possibility that the same string will be displayed differently on a
   system set for right-to-left display and a system set for left-to-
   right display; however, passwords are typically not displayed at all
   and are rarely meant to be interoperable across different systems in
   the way that non-secret strings like domain names and user names are.


4.  Migration

   The rules defined in this specification differ slightly from those
   defined by the SASLprep specification [RFC4013].  The following
   sections describe these differences, along with their implications
   for migration, in more detail.

4.1.  User Names

   Deployments that currently use SASLprep for handling user names might
   need to scrub existing data when migrating to use of the rules
   defined in this specification.  In particular:

   o  SASLprep specified the use of Unicode Normalization Form KC
      (NFKC), whereas this usage of the PRECIS IdentifierClass employs
      Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC).  In practice this change is
      unlikely to cause significant problems, because NFKC provides
      methods for mapping Unicode code points with compatibility
      equivalents to those equivalents, whereas the PRECIS
      IdentifierClass entirely disallows Unicode code points with
      compatibility equivalents (i.e., during comparison NFKC is more
      "aggressive" about finding matches than is NFC).  A few examples
      might suffice to indicate the nature of the problem: (1) U+017F
      LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S is compatibility equivalent to U+0073
      LATIN SMALL LETTER S (2) U+2163 ROMAN NUMERAL FOUR is
      compatibility equivalent to U+0049 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I and
      U+0056 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER V (3) U+FB01 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI
      is compatibility equivalent to U+0066 LATIN SMALL LETTER F and
      U+0069 LATIN SMALL LETTER I. Under SASLprep, the use of NFKC also
      handled the mapping of fullwidth and halfwidth code points to



Saint-Andre & Melnikov  Expires October 27, 2013                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       PRECIS: Usernames and Passwords          April 2013


      their decomposition equivalents (see [I-D.ietf-precis-mappings]).
      Although it is expected that code points with compatibility
      equivalents are rare in existing user names, for migration
      purposes deployments might want to search their database of user
      names for Unicode code points with compatibility equivalents and
      map those code points to their compatibility equivalents.
   o  SASLprep mapped non-ASCII spaces to ASCII space (U+0020), whereas
      the PRECIS IdentifierClass entirely disallows non-ASCII spaces.
      The non-ASCII space characters are U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE, U+1680
      OGHAM SPACE MARK, U+180E MONGOLIAN VOWEL SEPARATOR, U+2000 EN QUAD
      through U+200A HAIR SPACE, U+202F NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE, U+205F
      MEDIUM MATHEMATICAL SPACE, and U+3000 IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE.  For
      migration purposes, deployments might want to convert non-ASCII
      space characters to ASCII space in simple user names.
   o  SASLprep mapped the "characters commonly mapped to nothing" from
      Appendix B.1 of [RFC3454]) to nothing, whereas the PRECIS
      IdentifierClass entirely disallows most of these characters, which
      correspond to the code points from the "M" category defined under
      Section 6.13 of [FRAMEWORK] (with the exception of U+1806
      MONGOLIAN TODO SOFT HYPHEN, which was "commonly mapped to nothing"
      in Unicode 3.2 but at the time of this writing does not have a
      derived property of Default_Ignorable_Code_Point in Unicode 6.1).
      For migration purposes, deployments might want to remove code
      points contained in the PRECIS "M" category from simple user
      names.
   o  SASLprep allowed uppercase and titlecase characters, whereas this
      usage of the PRECIS IdentifierClass maps uppercase and titlecase
      characters to their lowercase equivalents.  For migration
      purposes, deployments can either convert uppercase and titlecase
      characters to their lowercase equivalents in simple user names
      (thus losing the case information) or preserve uppercase and
      titlecase characters and ignore the case difference when comparing
      simple user names.

4.2.  Passwords

   Depending on local service policy, migration from RFC 4013 to this
   specification might not involve any scrubbing of data (since
   passwords might not be stored in the clear anyway); however, service
   providers need to be aware of possible issues that might arise during
   migration.  In particular:

   o  SASLprep specified the use of Unicode Normalization Form KC
      (NFKC), whereas this usage of the PRECIS FreeformClass employs
      Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC).  Because NFKC is more
      aggressive about finding matches than NFC, in practice this change
      is unlikely to cause significant problems and indeed has the
      security benefit of probably resulting in fewer false positives

Internet-Draft       PRECIS: Usernames and Passwords          April 2013


      when comparing passwords.  A few examples might suffice to
      indicate the nature of the problem: (1) U+017F LATIN SMALL LETTER
      LONG S is compatibility equivalent to U+0073 LATIN SMALL LETTER S
      (2) U+2163 ROMAN NUMERAL FOUR is compatibility equivalent to
      U+0049 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I and U+0056 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER V
      (3) U+FB01 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI is compatibility equivalent to
      U+0066 LATIN SMALL LETTER F and U+0069 LATIN SMALL LETTER I. Under
      SASLprep, the use of NFKC also handled the mapping of fullwidth
      and halfwidth code points to their decomposition equivalents (see
      [I-D.ietf-precis-mappings]).  Although it is expected that code
      points with compatibility equivalents are rare in existing
      passwords, some passwords that matched when SASLprep was used
      might no longer work when the rules in this specification are
      applied.
   o  SASLprep mapped the "characters commonly mapped to nothing" from
      Appendix B.1 of [RFC3454]) to nothing, whereas the PRECIS
      FreeformClass entirely disallows such characters, which correspond
      to the code points from the "M" category defined under Section
      6.13 of [FRAMEWORK] (with the exception of U+1806 MONGOLIAN TODO
      SOFT HYPHEN, which was commonly mapped to nothing in Unicode 3.2
      but at the time of this writing is allowed by Unicode 6.1).  In
      practice, this change will probably have no effect on comparison,
      but user-oriented software might reject such code points instead
      of ignoring them during password preparation.


5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Password/Passphrase Strength

   The ability to include a wide range of characters in passwords and
   passphrases can increase the potential for creating a strong password
   with high entropy.  However, in practice, the ability to include such
   characters ought to be weighed against the possible need to reproduce
   them on various devices using various input methods.

5.2.  Reuse of PRECIS

   The security considerations described in [FRAMEWORK] apply to the
   "IdentifierClass" and "FreeformClass" base string classes used in
   this document for simple user names and passwords, respectively.

5.3.  Reuse of Unicode

   The security considerations described in [UTR39] apply to the use of
   Unicode characters in user names and passwords.

   Subclass:  No.
   Replaces:  The SASLprep profile of Stringprep.
   Width Mapping:  Map fullwidth and halfwidth characters to their
      decomposition equivalents.
   Additional Mappings:  None.
   Case Mapping:  Map uppercase and titlecase characters to lowercase.
   Normalization:  NFC.
   Directionality:  The "Bidi Rule" defined in RFC 5893 applies.
   Specification:  RFC XXXX.  [Note to RFC Editor: please change XXXX to
      the number issued for this specification.]

6.2.  Use of FreeformClass

   The IANA shall add an entry to the PRECIS Usage Registry for reuse of
   the PRECIS FreeformClass in SASL, as follows:

   Applicability:  Passwords in SASL and Kerberos.
   Base Class:  FreeformClass
   Subclass:  No.
   Replaces:  The SASLprep profile of Stringprep.
   Width Mapping:  None.
   Additional Mappings:  Map non-ASCII space characters to ASCII space.
   Case Mapping:  None.
   Normalization:  NFC.
   Directionality:  None.
   Specification:  RFC XXXX.  [Note to RFC Editor: please change XXXX to
      the number issued for this specification.]


7.  Open Issues

   We need to compare the output obtained when applying the new rules
   with Unicode 3.2 and Unicode 6.1 data to the output obtained when
   applying the SASLprep rules with Unicode 3.2 data, then make sure
   that the PRECIS Working Group and KITTEN Working Group are
   comfortable with any changes to the Unicode characters that are
   allowed and disallowed.  (See also the migration issues described
   under Section 4.)

Appendix A.  Differences from RFC 4013

   The following substantive modifications were made from RFC 4013.

   o  A single SASLprep algorithm was replaced by two separate
      algorithms: one for simple user names and another for passwords.
   o  The new preparation algorithms use PRECIS instead of a stringprep
      profile.  The new algorithms work independenctly of Unicode
      versions.
   o  As recommended in the PRECIS framwork, changed the Unicode
      normalization form from NFKC to NFC.
   o  Some Unicode code points that were mapped to nothing in RFC 4013
      are simply disallowed by PRECIS.
